# Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-on-Maze

Using Deep Reinforcement Learning techniques in order to solve random mazes.

I used a convolutional neural network with a fully connected part in order to learn the q-values of the game. I imported a package written by Dale O'Brien in order to generate random mazes of various size.
