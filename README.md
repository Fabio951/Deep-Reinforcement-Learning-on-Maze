# Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-on-Maze

Using Deep Reinforcement Learning techniques in order to solve random mazes. So far it is represented just as a mouse-cheese game with walls. On future updates I would like to introduce a cat agent, which has to reach the mouse before it reaches the cheese, doors and buttons to open them.

I used a convolutional neural network with a fully connected part in order to learn the q-values of the game. I imported a package written by Dale O'Brien in order to generate random mazes of various sizes. 

Some bugs may be present. For any information, please do not hesitate to contact me at fabio.semenzato@gmail.com.
